# Note and Thoughts

- chose to make font-size of the root element 62.5% - equates to 10px assuming the default browser font-size is 16px
  - this makes it easy to conver px to rem
- puzzles section - the chess board asset is sized slightly different than on the design
  - I chose to make this section shorter to kep the distance between the elements the same as the design
